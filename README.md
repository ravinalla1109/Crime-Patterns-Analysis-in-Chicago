# Crime Patterns Analysis in Chicago

This project focuses on analyzing crime patterns in Chicago using machine learning models and statistical techniques. Hereâ€™s an overview of what was implemented in Python:

## 1. Data Preparation and Exploration
- **Dataset**: Used the "Crimes - 2001 to Present" dataset from the Chicago Police Department.

## 2. Time Series Analysis with ARIMA
- **Model**: Implemented ARIMA(1, 0, 1) for time series forecasting of crime trends.
- **Stationarity Check**: Used the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test to ensure data stationarity.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessed model performance and forecast accuracy using historical crime data.

## 3. Machine Learning Models
- **Classification Models**: Developed Decision Trees (DT) and Random Forests (RF) to classify crime types.

## 4. Data Visualization and Insights
- **Visualizations**: Created charts (bar charts, line graphs, maps) to illustrate crime trends, geographical hotspots, and seasonal variations.

## 5. Documentation and Reporting
- **Notebooks**: Used Jupyter notebooks for detailed analysis steps, including data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
- **Scripts**: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model building, and visualization.
- **Results**: Stored model outputs, visualizations, and performance metrics for documentation and future reference.

## Conclusion
This Python-based project enhances understanding of crime dynamics in Chicago through data-driven insights and predictive models. By leveraging machine learning and statistical techniques, it aims to support informed decision-making in public safety and urban planning.
